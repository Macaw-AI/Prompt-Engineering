Mr. Smith:  Hi Baxter! It's nice to meet you. I have heard you like talking about hobbies. What hobbies do you have?
Baxter: Well, i am not sure if i like talking about them becouse i dont have any at the moment.
Mr. Smith:  I see. That's understandable. Do you have any particular interests that you can develop into a hobby?
Baxter: Hmmm... I like wilderness and nature, but i am not sure how i could develop it further.
Mr. Smith:  There are a lot of outdoor activities you can do, like hiking, camping, kayaking, and mountain biking. These activities can help you get closer to nature, and they can also help with your self-development and making relationships with others. Why do you think it's important to have hobbies?
Baxter: Maybe it can be relaxing ? I dunno.
Mr. Smith:  Having hobbies can be a great way to relax and escape from the daily routine. It can also help with your self-development, because it allows you to explore your interests and discover new things. Having hobbies can also help you to build strong relationships with others, as you can connect with people that share the same interests. What do you think?
Baxter: It may be but not exactly in my situation becouse i am kinda socially awkaward.
Mr. Smith:  I understand. It can be difficult to find a hobby that suits you at first, but there are lots of activities and interests out there that you can explore. Have you ever considered taking up a hobby or activity that you think you might enjoy? If not, it might be worth trying something out and seeing how it fits.
Baxter: What would you suggest for example ?
Mr. Smith:  That's a great question. It really depends on what interests you. Have you ever thought about photography, playing a musical instrument, cooking, or perhaps a sport? Those are just a few ideas, but there are so many hobbies out there that you can explore.
Baxter: My grandpa had a great hobby
Mr. Smith:  That's wonderful to hear! What kind of hobby did he have?
Baxter: Photography, he took lots of photo when he was serving in WW2
Mr. Smith:  Wow, that sounds like an incredible experience. Did he ever share any of his photos with you? It must have been so fascinating to see places from his perspective.
Baxter: Oh yes he did. Some of them was drastic, but this is reality of the war isnt it ?
Mr. Smith:  Absolutely. War is a difficult and heartbreaking subject, but it's important to remember the stories of those who were affected. I'm glad that your grandpa shared his photos with you. Do you think you might be interested in trying photography yourself?
Baxter: Yes, it may be fun expierence and it also could work as a my memorial of him, sadly he died last summer.
Mr. Smith:  I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been a difficult time. It sounds like photography is a hobby that you would like to pursue to remember your grandpa. What other hobbies do you think you might be interested in trying?
Baxter: I'd like to maybe mix it with other activity. What would be a good example of said activity ?
Mr. Smith:  That's a great idea! There are plenty of activities you can mix with photography, such as painting, writing, or even culinary arts. What type of activities are you interested in exploring?
Baxter: Culinary arts ? How it goes well with photography ?
Mr. Smith:  Combining the two can be very rewarding! Photography allows you to capture the moments of creating a dish, while culinary arts gives you the pleasure of experiencing the flavors and smells of the food. What kind of dishes do you think you would like to try making?
Baxter: I am a big fun of fastfoods.
