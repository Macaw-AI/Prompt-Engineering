Mr. Wernor:  Good morning Baxter, how are you today? 

Baxter: I fell ok, what about you ?
Mr. Wernor:  I'm doing great, thank you. Now, let's talk about the main topic. Tell me, what do you know about debates between ancient civilizations such as the Romans and the Greeks?
Baxter: Not much to be honest
Mr. Wernor:  Alright, let's start from the basics. What do you know about the technologies of the past that were used in these civilizations?
Baxter: They discovered ballz ?
Mr. Wernor:  Yes, that's true. But let's focus on more advanced technology. What do you know about the changes in human history that the Romans and Greeks brought about?
Baxter: I remember that in previous class aqueducts were given as example, but i dont know exactly what's that.
Mr. Wernor:  An aqueduct is an engineering structure used to transport water from one source to another. The Romans and Greeks were among the first civilizations to build these structures. Can you tell me what other technologies they developed?
Baxter: Not really
Mr. Wernor:  Well, the Romans and Greeks developed many other technologies, including road construction and sanitation systems. They also developed a form of democracy to govern their societies. What do you think of the social and political systems they created?
Baxter: I think they've made a big mistake giving the power to whole society.
Mr. Wernor:  It's true that democracy can have its drawbacks, but it's also a system that can create a more equitable society. What do you think are the benefits of democracy?
Baxter: Well, it gives a feeling of making a change but in reality that not true and everythings belongs to the system what in result makes your vote doesnt matter 
Mr. Wernor:  That's a fair point. Democracy can be an imperfect system, but it can also provide an opportunity for people to have their voices heard and to work together to make the changes they want. Do you think the good old days were better than now?
Baxter: They pace of life was probably slower than now and it may make it a little bit less stressful i guess ?
Mr. Wernor:  That's a valid point, and it's true that life can be more stressful now with the increased pace of modern life and the advances in technology. However, it's also true that technology has allowed us to do more and to find new ways of solving problems. What do you think of the advances in technology over the years?
Baxter: Those advances were huge and fast since Industrial Revolution, and i am afraid they may be too fast for us to handle consequencions soon.
Mr. Wernor:  That's an interesting point of view, Baxter. What do you think are some of the most significant advances in technology in the past few centuries?
Baxter: Penicilin, Electricity, Power of atom
Mr. Wernor:  Those are certainly significant advances indeed! How do you think these technologies have impacted the way people live their lives?
Baxter: We have more possibilities with things like Internet but also more things that bother us
Mr. Wernor:  That's true, the internet does open up new possibilities but also poses new challenges. Do you think the advances in technology have brought more benefit or more harm?
Baxter: it is hard to say, but i am starting to think that it has brought more harm, just look at climate changes and levels of depression amongs people htat is spiking through the roof, also our culture seems tasteless nowadays 
Mr. Wernor:  Those are all valid concerns. Technology does come with both benefits and drawbacks. Let's branch away from technology and look at ancient civilizations for a moment. What do you think are some of the most important aspects of ancient civilizations like the Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians that we should look at and learn from?
Baxter: I think they culture, it seems so more advanced than us
Mr. Wernor:
